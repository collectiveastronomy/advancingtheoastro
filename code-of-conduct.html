Taken from the  <a href=" https://vanderbilt.irisregistration.com/Home/Site?code=InclusiveAstronomy2015" target="_blank">Inclusive Astronomy guidelines</a>
</p>

<p>
<b>Respect the preferred pronouns of others.</b> To help make sure that nobody is singled out, please include your preferred pronouns on your badge. If you're not sure how to do this, please ask!

<p>
<b>Share the air.</b> If you have been dominating the discussion or participating disproportionately, let others participate. Alternatively, if you haven't said much, you are encouraged to participate more.
</p>

<p>
<b>Be aware of power dynamics in the room.</b> A frequent occurrence in discussions is that members of historically overrepresented groups often dominate the discussion. We should ask ourselves the questions: Who is talking the most? Who is asking the most questions?
Who are the first people to be called on? Is anyone being ignored? Who is being left out of the conversation, both in and out of the room?
</p>
<p>
<b>Lean into discomfort.</b> Discussions about racism, sexism, heterosexism, cissexism, and ableism often require us to examine issues that we do not want to talk about. However, the most progress is often made by leaning into our own discomfort so that we are able to address what needs to be addressed.
</p>
<p>
<b>Use “both/and” rather than “either/or” thinking.</b> When confronting complex issues, the use of "either/or" thinking often oversimplifies situations and makes it more difficult to resolve conflicts. In contrast, "both/and" thinking allows us to recognize that truths are multifaceted and to come up with more options.
</p>
<p>
<b>Recognize that intent ≠ impact.</b> We can generally assume that nearly all of us are coming into this meeting with good intentions. However, sometimes we end up saying or doing something that is hurtful even when we have good intentions.
</p>
<p>
<b>Speak to your own experience.</b> Using “I” or “we” statements often helps with avoiding generalizations and also the dynamic of explaining back to someone about their own oppressions they face.
</p>
<p>
<b>Be aware of intersectionality.</b> The most common practice in astronomy diversity efforts is to focus on a single dimension of identity. This approach leaves behind, for example, women of color who are impacted by the intersection of racism and sexism. At this meeting and when working toward diversity, equity, and inclusion at your home institutions, it is necessary to take a multidimensional approach.
</p>
<p>
<b>Discuss the message, not the messenger.</b> Focus discussion and commentary on what is being spoken, not who is speaking. For example, identifying a statement as racist, rather than the person making the statement. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Oops, ouch.</b> Part of having these conversations is messing up. If you say something that is hurtful or problematic and you realize is, you can say “oops” to acknowledge it and then try again. Alternatively, if someone else said something hurtful or problematic, then you can say “ouch” which serves as a marker that there is something that needs to be discussed further. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Private thoughts, public meeting.</b> We encourage you to tweet all that you are learning at the meeting, however, we request that you not tweet personal narratives from participants without first obtaining their permission. This allows us to share useful information with others while still respecting an individual’s right to privacy.
